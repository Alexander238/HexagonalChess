# HexagonalChess

The Idea was to create hexagonal chess in python, but I lost motivation when I found out that python probably was not the best choice to do this.
It would be inconvenient for online-multiplay, even though I probably could've implemented all the logic in python and use that logic in some web-application. 

Maybe I'll start working on this again, but I would use javascript with a nodejs server this time.
